# üß† Advanced Algorithms Implementation

This document describes the advanced optimization algorithms that have been added to the Delivery Route Optimization system.

## üöÄ Implemented Algorithms

### 1. Branch and Bound Optimization
**File**: `BranchAndBoundOptimizationStrategy.java`

**Algorithm Overview**:
- Uses intelligent pruning to reduce search space
- Guarantees optimal solution while avoiding exhaustive search
- Calculates lower bounds using Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) heuristic
- Prunes branches that cannot lead to better solutions

**Key Features**:
- **Time Complexity**: Better than O(n!) due to pruning
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for recursion stack
- **Optimality**: Guaranteed optimal solution
- **Performance**: Good for medium-sized problems (8-12 orders)

**Implementation Highlights**:
```java
// Lower bound calculation using MST
private double calculateLowerBound(List<Integer> currentPath, int nextLocation, 
                                 boolean[] visited, double currentTime, double[][] distanceMatrix)

// Intelligent pruning
if (lowerBound >= bestSolutionTime) {
    nodesPruned++;
    continue;
}
```

**Performance Metrics**:
- Tracks nodes explored and pruned
- Shows efficiency compared to brute force
- Fallback to greedy for very large datasets (>12 orders)

### 2. Dynamic Programming Optimization (Held-Karp Algorithm)
**File**: `DynamicProgrammingOptimizationStrategy.java`

**Algorithm Overview**:
- Classic Held-Karp algorithm for TSP
- Uses memoization to avoid recalculating subproblems
- Bottom-up approach building solutions for increasing subset sizes
- Optimal solution with exponential time but better space usage than brute force

**Key Features**:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n¬≤ √ó 2^n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(n √ó 2^n) for memoization
- **Optimality**: Guaranteed optimal solution
- **Performance**: Good for small to medium problems (up to 10-12 orders)

**Implementation Highlights**:
```java
// Memoization table for subproblems
Map<String, Double> memo = new HashMap<>();
Map<String, List<Integer>> pathMemo = new HashMap<>();

// Dynamic programming state transition
for (int subsetSize = 2; subsetSize <= n - 1; subsetSize++) {
    // Build solutions for increasing subset sizes
}
```

**State Representation**:
- Uses bitmasks to represent visited sets
- Key format: `"mask,lastLocation"`
- Efficient subset enumeration and processing
